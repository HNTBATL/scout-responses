['Loss of trees/tree canopy'];ALL, but again, they aren't on my daily routine. They're all way far west.;;;"As I wrote above, when you said EAST, I got excited, thinking that maybe, just maybe, east OTP would get some better transit that could make car usage to shop intown less appealing, and improve transit for folks who routinely have to spend upwards of an hour one-way.  As it is, if I am going to walk almost a mile to the bus stop, wait for the bus to get to the train, wait for the train .... or even drive to Indian Creek, Kensington, or Avondale stations and take the train -- I can just drive intown.  Even knowing I will have to wrestle with parking is less hassle.  I would love to take MARTA more often; I have visited enough places in the world with functioning metros that actually were intended for traffic reduction among all social classes, not just relegated to those who had no other option, that I know how valuable they are.  In England I stayed with a friend at St. Alban's.  Within 3/10 of a mile (my measurement) there was a train station.  That whisked me right into London, and I could walk to the British Library to do my work every day.  I traveled all over San Francisco using BART, and never saw driving as more convenient, even though I had access to a car.  Car usage was about even-Steven with the metro in Portland or Seattle, but the metro was a viable option for almost anything.  But here in the south or southwest -- metro lines were primarily maid and working class lines, and it shows.  (I know the ATL ballooned in the 80s and 90s, so the current metro limits make some sense, and I know those eedjits up in Cobb and down in McDonough fought metro expansion very effectively---which makes current traffic unsustainable and makes me glad I chose to live east. Especially when that section of 85 collapsed a couple of years ago .... All the same, while I am very glad to see expansion, wht about REALLY coming East?  Even better, South east, which is massively underserved?  The rich folks in Kirkwood and intown already have options.)

;;My primary concern here is conflicts between cars and the streetcar. I'd recommend blocking vehicular access to Irwin Street between the intersections with Sampson Street and Krog Street.;My comments on this section largely mirror those made for question 6E.;I urge you to reconsider the lack of dedicated lanes on Edgewood Ave and the retaining of on-street parking. We've had the streetcar for over six years, and we know what works and what doesn't. I would much rather see bus rapid transit projects prioritized over this if MARTA is planning on repeating failures. The current streetcar is counterintuitively closed on days when the city experiences high traffic for an event. This demonstrates that not even MARTA views it as transportation. If you want people to ride, you have to prioritize them instead of everyone else. The BeltLine sections are designed well, but on-street sections are setting up this entire line for low ridership and disappointment.;;donotlive;{'Near places with the highest number of jobs': '4', 'Near places with the greatest potential for redevelopment': '5', 'Near places with the highest number of residents (apartments, condominiums)': '1', 'Near places with the highest number of destinations (shopping, restaurants, services)': '2', 'Near places with a high number of community facilities (parks, churches, recreational)': '3'};The crossing points seem well-spaced.;sometimes;I believe the reduction in parking is insufficient.

Voters, including me, passed the increased sales tax in 2016. Collections began in April 2017, but this project is not scheduled to be complete until 2027. That's way too long!

To really be useful as a proof of concept the concept should be presented to the public as soon as possible.    
Fix the Existing Streetcar
    Reduce transit times by getting the streetcar out of traffic.
    Support lane closures to vehicles both on the original route and the extension where practical.
    Increased frequency of service (every 10 minutes instead of every 15).
    Install a new station at the corner of Luckie Street and Forsyth Street to connect Peachtree Center MARTA to eastbound riders.
    Give the streetcar the right of way by installing priority signaling across the entire route (both existing and new).

['Loss of trees/tree canopy'];;Probably the most crucial part for traffic. Signal prioritization is key and would possibly need something like the traffic signals of the HAWK crossings and have them just before Sampson on the west side and at the beltline (Lake Ave) on the east side to hold traffic  while the streetcar passes. Will be crucial when there are events at KSM area;;Given that signal prioritization is coming I think another step that needs to come is removal of street parking on the side the track is running to avoid those types of delays along the route. The sidewalk can be widened to accommodate more pedestrian throughput.

It's horrible for cyclist and drivers alike, and barley passable for pedestrians. Adding a streetcar in the current state is impossible in my opinion. The road either needs to be closed to cars here or some really intricate signaling needs to be installed and programmed. ;"This is beautiful and makes me cry tears of joy.
I worry that if the sidewalk here is super busy than people will be standing in the bike lane, so maybe install a barrier/planters to keep it separated. Also try to make the turn at Jackson street less 90 degree and smoother. Maybe a diagonal crossing like is already at a lot of lights on the Beltline.";"- Why does the streetcar only go up to 25 mph even though it will have it's own RoW on the trail sections? Factoring in stops and waiting time I feel like that speed is more comparable to biking than a true modal alternative.
- Please push to get as much dedicated RoW for the street car. You and I both know that enforcement for parking in the street and other stuff will be poor/lax as it always is, so the only way to ensure the path is clear is to get the cars out of the way. Literally every other road in this city caters to cars, bikes, transit, and the vibrant businesses on Edgewood deserve a true street for people.
- Reconsider not choosing alignment alternative 2. It's better for everyone that will ride the streetcar one day, and only worse for a few people against progress. Doesn't seem fair to select a longer route, inconveniencing everyone, at the benefit of a very few.

This would take so much pressure off of Edgewood and limit the inevitable bottlenecks that 2-way streetcar traffic would cause on the ALREADY congested street.  I feel as if having one-way streetcar on both Edgewood and Auburn would at least give MARTA the option to possibly bypass Edgewood on extremely busy nights when the streetcar would surely get stuck.  If it has to be 2-way on Edgewood, we HAVE to have options where Edgewood is closed to through vehicular traffic.  

2) I think there needs to be another stop around the Edgewood & Randolph intersection.  The distance from the Boulevard stop to the Irwin stop is already about twice as long as most of the other stop distances.

['other'];;I am worried about vehicles causing major delays in the streetcar. This would likely be the biggest conflict point for cars, transit, bikes, and pedestrians on the whole route. Maybe this section of Irwin should be closed to vehicles.;I am very supportive of a cycle track here so long as it is at least as wide as the 10th street cycle track and provides actual protection from vehicles. I also would love to see floating stations.;"1. Trust. The biggest reason I never use the streetcar today despite living within a 10 minute walk is the embarrassing headways and inconsistency. Why would anyone use transit they can't trust? Will MARTA extend streetcar hours to match heavy rail? Will the streetcar continue to suspend service during major events? Will the streetcar continue to get delayed by personal vehicles?
2. We need dedicated ROW or, at a minimum, signal priority. And not just the kind that holds a green light or shortens a red light, I want it to turn green for the streetcar automatically.
3. Edgewood should be closed to personal vehicles. Otherwise the streetcar will be unable to maintain a schedule.
4. The streetcar needs to run as late as MARTA heavy rail and weekend service should mirror weekday.
5. I like the current number of stations. Any more would slow things down too much.
6. I would prefer to see the base of the track on the beltline to be grass.

['other'];;;;"Possibly out of scope, but I'd love to see a cycle track ::ON:: the beltline itself! There is certainly demand for it and this would significantly enhance bike commuter mobility. Regarding the bike facilities in Question 11, I have two thoughts: 
1. It seems to me to be best to continue and expand upon the existing network, or at least keep future continuation in mind. Protected, two-way cycle tracks are great, but if it's just a brief segment, and cyclists are forced back into the conventional bike lanes or into shared car lanes after a 1/2 mile, this creates extra conflict points at intersections, and it seems to make more sense to continue the conventional bike lanes. 
2. Thought needs to be put into the larger network! Atlanta typically installs bike infrastructure in tiny segments that don't connect. An ideal network would link destinations to existing infrastructure, i.e. the beltline and FP trail.

I ride my bike all of the time, and it would be amazing to have bike paths and street cars in the area to really help ease traffic and give people an alternate way to get around.  It is going to be essential for our city to have better transportation as we continue to grow.

['Loss of on-street parking', 'Impacts to current property values', 'Impact to pedestrian/cyclist experience on the BeltLine trail', 'other'];I think traffic calming measures should be used in place of completely closing roads to vehicular traffic, as well as expanding space for bike lanes and pedestrian spaces (particularly along Irwin St).Perhaps limiting on-street parking (or making it closer to the main roadway to slow drivers), narrowing the main roadway, and using that extra space to create dedicated bike lanes as well as expanding the sidewalks (as 2 separate entities, in order to separate bicyclists from pedestrians). Also, lower the speed limit on that section of Irwin St from 30 to 25 mph, as well as create raised pedestrian crossings similar to how the Beltline currently crosses the street.;Please re-route. The stretch of Irwin St between Auburn Ave and Krog St at the Beltline crossing is one of the most congested, if not the most congested segment of Irwin St, especially on the Weekends or Holidays. Perhaps run the Streetcar on Krog St instead and cross at the 4-way stop with Irwin St/Lake Ave (and include a stop at Krog St Market?), or perhaps run the Streetcar down Randolph St and use John Wesley Dobbs Ave or McGruder St to then cut over to the Beltline. In that scenario, could also include a stop at/near Ladybird Mess Hall.;Same concerns as my answer to 6E.;Try to convince the mayor's office to enact rent control in the area, as to fight increased gentrification and prevent lower-income residents being forced to move out of the area.;;morethanayear;{'Near places with the highest number of jobs': '3', 'Near places with the greatest potential for redevelopment': '5', 'Near places with the highest number of residents (apartments, condominiums)': '1', 'Near places with the highest number of destinations (shopping, restaurants, services)': '2', 'Near places with a high number of community facilities (parks, churches, recreational)': '4'};The Beltline and Streetcars need to be completely separated with no at-grade crossings as not to disrupt traffic on either route.;sometimes;Same concerns as my answer to 6G. Plus, the reduction of on-street parking on Auburn Ave will instead cause those people to park elsewhere (on perhaps a busier road) instead of the relatively less-busy Auburn Ave. If there is any road to eliminate on-street parking on, it should be Irwin St between Krog St and Randolph St. Perhaps run a bike lane down Auburn Ave instead to connect with the Beltline?;cycle-track;['I do not support partial closures of existing streets to vehicular traffic', 'other'];['Edgewood Avenue, between Jackson Street and Boulevard SE', 'Edgewood Avenue, between Hillard Street SE and Jackson Street'];This stop is in a great location with easy access to the residences along the beltline, but again, ensure that the Beltline and Streetcars are completely grade-separated as to not disrupt traffic and safety on either.;['Commuter', 'Student', 'Employed'];Try to limit traffic on both Edgewood Ave (esp. Edgewood Ave) and Boulevard as to try to prevent the Streetcar from getting stuck in or blocked by traffic. Also put in protected crossings for the bike lanes crossing Boulevard on both Edgewood and Auburn, as that stretch of Boulevard is incredibly busy and could cause a cyclist to feel unsafe crossing. Also limit/eliminate left-hand turns off Edgewood/Auburn as to increase traffic flow.;The Beltline and Streetcars need to be completely separated with no at-grade crossings as not to disrupt traffic on either route. The stop is in a good location though, with easy access to both Ponce City Market as well as the 725 Ponce Kroger.;Long-term increased vehicle traffic around the already somewhat congested Old Fourth Ward/Streetcar East Extension area.;The Beltline and Streetcars need to be completely separated with no at-grade crossings as not to disrupt traffic on either route.

Cutting down the trail to just one part may cause issues. Is the full bridge width really needed for two tracks?

Also, there were plans at some point for vertical access to Ponce on the west side of the trail. I assume that's been considered in the plans?

And by protection, I do not feel flexible plastic bollards, but hard infrastructure like concrete curbs, pile-ons, planters, etc. That remains my top priority as a daily bike commuter who has 4 kids biking to Grady cluster schools every day. The Irwin Randolph area must consider school access for walkers and bikers to Howard, which is currently marginal and hopefully could be improved by future strategic planning around this expansion project.;let's take advantage of public transit to allow teachers and students to get to and from schools and colleges safely - these are permanent structures serving a diverse constituency, and would save thousands of daily car trips per year!

['other'];;An additional station closer to the Krog street tunnel would be far more optimal to better connect neighborhoods that already feel disconnected south of Hulsey yard. The edgewood stop should be moved east of Howell street near Randolph, closer to the BeltLine, Krog tunnel, etc..

The current station position is awkward if approaching from the south and requires too much navigation. Given the unlikelihood of the street car to extend through Krog st tunnel anytime in the near future, providing easy of access for the rapidly growing Reyndoldstown and Cabbagetown neighborhoods should be considered. ;;;;morethanayear;{'Near places with the highest number of jobs': '2', 'Near places with the greatest potential for redevelopment': '5', 'Near places with the highest number of residents (apartments, condominiums)': '1', 'Near places with the highest number of destinations (shopping, restaurants, services)': '3', 'Near places with a high number of community facilities (parks, churches, recreational)': '4'};;sometimes;;couplet;['Irwin Street, between Sampson Street and Krog Street', 'Edgewood Avenue, between Jackson Street and Boulevard SE', 'Edgewood Avenue, between Hillard Street SE and Jackson Street'];['Irwin Street, between Sampson Street and Krog Street', 'Edgewood Avenue, between Hillard Street SE and Jackson Street', 'Edgewood Avenue, between Jackson Street and Boulevard SE'];;['Commuter', 'Employed'];;;That it is not happening fast enough.;;;[{'x': -84.36321042067867, 'y': 33.75221193923649}, {'x': -84.36372196822924, 'y': 33.753572439658264}, {'x': -84.35675484649384, 'y': 33.75243209339145}, {'x': -84.36415665372775, 'y': 33.75463360385037}, {'x': -84.36415548026132, 'y': 33.75753806161119}, {'x': -84.37097516431938, 'y': 33.7514325792288}, {'x': -84.35175068266179, 'y': 33.748538089980094}, {'x': -84.36496200401162, 'y': 33.77112932838362}, {'x': -84.35065818540306, 'y': 33.753392290627325, 'type': 'home'}, {'x': -84.38326496220674, 'y': 33.783813641225386, 'type': 'work'}, {'x': -84.36380302123281, 'y': 33.757233529533, 'type': 'meet'}, {'x': -84.3644787702665, 'y': 33.75560520533291, 'type': 'play'}];Jordan;Angel;30317

MARTA says it will take SIX more years to design and build a little more than two miles of light rail. Other experts say it can be done in as few as three years. We concur and urge you to ask for a shorter construction timeline. 2027 is too late!

Fix the Existing Streetcar

Reduce transit times by getting the streetcar out of traffic.

Support lane closures to vehicles both on the original route and the extension where practical.

Increased frequency of service (every 10 minutes instead of every 15).

Install a new station at the corner of Luckie Street and Forsyth Street to connect Peachtree Center MARTA to eastbound riders.

Give the streetcar the right of way by installing priority signaling across the entire route (both existing and new).

Build a Better BeltLine Rail

Move stops are closer to cross-streets (like Highland and Ralph McGill) so that it is easier for pedestrians and cyclists to connect.

Improve connectivity for cyclists and pedestrians at stations by installing amenities like secure bicycle lockers and Beltline-branded shelters and benches.

Furthermore, it's important to get this segment complete so that we can extend north as well as south into my neighborhood (Reynoldstown).

Instead of a lush meadow that cradles a transit, are we getting an unwelcoming surface, hostile to pedestrians - especially those with disabilities? I hope not.

We must preserve this essential, green, and unique BeltLine design detail.

A few additional comments:
1 Accelerate the build timeline. Experts say it can be done in as few as three years. Why must we wait until 2027? It is just too late!

2. Fix the Existing Streetcar. Reduce transit times by getting the streetcar out of vehicular traffic. Let's close lanes to vehicles both on the original route and the extension where practical.

3. Increased frequency of service (every 10 minutes instead of every 15). 

4. Add a new station at the corner of Luckie and Forsyth Streets to connect Peachtree Center MARTA to eastbound riders.

5. Give the streetcar the right of way by installing priority signaling across the entire route (both existing and new).

5. Build a Better BeltLine Rail. Move stops closer to cross-streets (like Highland and Ralph McGill) so that it is easier for pedestrians and cyclists to connect.

6. Improve connectivity for cyclists and pedestrians at stations by installing amenities like secure bicycle lockers and Beltline-branded shelters and benches.

We should be considering what other cities are using like automated bus rapid transit, which will allow for smaller cars and shorter headways.;;;[{'x': -84.36792373296146, 'y': 33.7558015591103}, {'x': -84.367936607532, 'y': 33.75573911840462}, {'x': -84.36801170938446, 'y': 33.754281560997384}, {'x': -84.36753320323066, 'y': 33.75429583339173}, {'x': -84.3665697538833, 'y': 33.754294049504196}, {'x': -84.36655258784381, 'y': 33.75440822864383}, {'x': -84.36654829621118, 'y': 33.7545652247551}, {'x': -84.3665461504767, 'y': 33.7547739578077}, {'x': -84.36670279154868, 'y': 33.75482391095865}, {'x': -84.36695599214524, 'y': 33.75642596388704}, {'x': -84.36702465663055, 'y': 33.755730198512744}, {'x': -84.3689665761213, 'y': 33.755842591748326}, {'x': -84.36995362903889, 'y': 33.75585507989165}, {'x': -84.3698205913735, 'y': 33.75547686714317}, {'x': -84.36997508671101, 'y': 33.75549470740402}, {'x': -84.37202214866421, 'y': 33.7554590268446}, {'x': -84.37180740958594, 'y': 33.755473802459335}, {'x': -84.37151773117601, 'y': 33.75545596219415}, {'x': -84.37136323600221, 'y': 33.75547023439298}, {'x': -84.37126882221216, 'y': 33.75545596219415}, {'x': -84.37111218114018, 'y': 33.75546131426047}, {'x': -84.36794824769757, 'y': 33.757609924686044}, {'x': -84.36893208193118, 'y': 33.75761706067452}, {'x': -84.36996848751879, 'y': 33.75762419657731}, {'x': -84.3710196811159, 'y': 33.757643414701306}, {'x': -84.37210543929207, 'y': 33.75766482250343}, {'x': -84.37213172507148, 'y': 33.75590334638814}, {'x': -84.36564184728591, 'y': 33.75757664776282}, {'x': -84.3648940473637, 'y': 33.75757307978398}, {'x': -84.36428210143437, 'y': 33.75753048720821}, {'x': -84.3655094804597, 'y': 33.75434194753372}, {'x': -84.36414611360931, 'y': 33.75462181990066}, {'x': -84.36291913714439, 'y': 33.75490503646183}, {'x': -84.36387145579081, 'y': 33.75349117450408}, {'x': -84.3777329773705, 'y': 33.75439948343423}, {'x': -84.37759350250171, 'y': 33.754397699378714}, {'x': -84.37746904793791, 'y': 33.754397699378714}, {'x': -84.3773467392723, 'y': 33.754397699378714}, {'x': -84.37723301354457, 'y': 33.75439413126758}, {'x': -84.37713645402002, 'y': 33.75439413126758}, {'x': -84.37700985372176, 'y': 33.75438877913462}, {'x': -84.3767995686332, 'y': 33.75441910794034}, {'x': -84.37658499191197, 'y': 33.75436737039529}, {'x': -84.37632320837756, 'y': 33.75440126738763}, {'x': -84.37616227583665, 'y': 33.75440483556651}, {'x': -84.37596701088938, 'y': 33.75440483556651}, {'x': -84.37591765834172, 'y': 33.754399483366164}, {'x': -84.3757867665745, 'y': 33.75440126745566}, {'x': -84.37564729170572, 'y': 33.75440661958784}, {'x': -84.37554644054853, 'y': 33.75438699507888}, {'x': -84.37528036538147, 'y': 33.754383426967294}, {'x': -84.37512801577842, 'y': 33.75437450672172}, {'x': -84.37491773068986, 'y': 33.75439591532316}, {'x': -84.37466238435887, 'y': 33.754363802453014}, {'x': -84.3745057434506, 'y': 33.754353098114926}, {'x': -84.37132330212691, 'y': 33.75432053913788}, {'x': -84.36981141543286, 'y': 33.75430266060206}, {'x': -84.36879003002736, 'y': 33.75429753155146}, {'x': -84.37789814116678, 'y': 33.75773443711664}, {'x': -84.36788895586008, 'y': 33.759293368193426}, {'x': -84.36992509126723, 'y': 33.75932568911416}, {'x': -84.3678791820723, 'y': 33.75954542863326}, {'x': -84.36786315906839, 'y': 33.76132604355745}, {'x': -84.36553513572113, 'y': 33.7613153401355}, {'x': -84.37204847803966, 'y': 33.753755375818685}, {'x': -84.37178454860707, 'y': 33.75308991803846}, {'x': -84.37117448025666, 'y': 33.75144286603165}, {'x': -84.37096526795357, 'y': 33.75151824466168}, {'x': -84.37105968170269, 'y': 33.75148300850198}, {'x': -84.3632923369302, 'y': 33.75219364858479}, {'x': -84.36685766326335, 'y': 33.75656155838053}, {'x': -84.37207160877813, 'y': 33.759355485563155}, {'x': -84.37429615757739, 'y': 33.75877127109071}, {'x': -84.37429213418201, 'y': 33.75957025726371}, {'x': -84.37430500891625, 'y': 33.76018393082683}, {'x': -84.37205302621093, 'y': 33.76008603768448}, {'x': -84.3687195444084, 'y': 33.75637288966759, 'type': 'home'}, {'x': -84.42415837547524, 'y': 33.65856175313684, 'type': 'work'}, {'x': -84.36034844058842, 'y': 33.75490610685974, 'type': 'play'}];Billy;Lockwood;30312

Same goes for the 3 new restaurants next to StapleHouse and Slutty Vegan Burgers.;"I have owned my condo at the corner of Edgewood and Randolph for 16 years, and this also is planned to still be my home after I retire in 12 years. I cannot express strongly enough how much my neighbors and I are upset over this plan to run the streetcar just feet from our place of comfort and peace.
The current large-format streetcar vehicle with old-fashioned overhead wires would be such a detriment to the quality of life on our small residential streets. The wires are a junky, visual blight that don't portray the transit as being modern. Since so few people ride it after being around for years, changing it to a smaller, eco-battery powered vehicle would be sufficient.
Another detriment to our peaceful residential area will be the constant, annoying ""ding-ding"" bell. I work near the Ferris wheel now, and the bell sound is enough to make anyone crazy; at least I don't have to listen to it at home (yet). I want to discuss options for reducing or eliminating the bell sound in our residential area. Safety is all good and fine until residents start moving away because of the ruined quality of life.
 
Many of my neighbors on Randolph would like to know why DeKalb Ave. isn't being considered, where there are fewer residences to be disturbed. It's the logical place for the streetcar to get onto the Beltline and would allow it to travel through the immensely popular entertainment/shopping district on the Beltline at Edgewood. Or let it run straight east on Irwin from Jackson to the Beltline; a lot fewer homeowners would be impacted and teachers could use it.
I will write to Bryan Hobbs to request a Zoom call with all the homeowners that would be impacted along the proposed path. By my count, it would be about 73 standalone and condo homes on Edgewood, Randolph and Auburn.
