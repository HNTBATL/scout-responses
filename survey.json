{"Question 3": ["Wider_sidewalks", "multi-use-path"], "Question 4": ["Employed", "Commuter"], "Question 5": "more-than-20", "Question 6": "once-per-month", "High-capacity transit will significantly improve travel times and reliability above the existing MARTA Route 83. However, building a major transit project could have some negative community impacts like property acquisition, restricted driveways, and environmental impacts. These impacts could influence how long it takes for the transit project to come to fruition. When considering these factors, I would prefer:": "Option B", "The Campbellton Corridor will be served by either Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) or Light Rail Transit (LRT). These modes have more similarities than differences in terms of service and amenities. Both BRT and LRT offer fast, reliable, and frequent service and enhanced passenger amenities. Although LRT can carry more people, it is more expensive, and will take longer to build than BRT. LRT also has higher property impacts and requires 144 driveway restrictions compared to only 20 driveway restrictions for the BRT. Which transit mode do you prefer?": "LRT"}
